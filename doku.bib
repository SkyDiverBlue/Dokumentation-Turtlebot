The first analysis of occupations across industries indicated that nursing aides, licensed practical nurses, and registered nurses all had high back injury ratios compared to other occupations. The second analysis of occupations within four parts of the health care industry indicated that aides in nursing and personal care facilities had the greatest problem with disabling back disorders. The article concludes with a list of research needs and suggested research methodologies.},

abstract = {People with visual impairment face enormous difficulties in terms of their mobility as they do not have enough information about their location and orientation with respect to traffic and obstacles on their route. Visually impaired people can navigate unknown areas by relying on the assistance of canes, other people, or specially trained guide dogs. The traditional ways of using guide dogs and long-cane only help to avoid obstacles, not to know where they are. The research presented in this paper introduces a mobile assistant navigation prototype to locate and direct blind people indoors. Since most of the existing navigation systems developed so far for blind people employ a complex conjunction of positioning systems, video cameras, location-based and image processing algorithms, we designed an affordable low-cost prototype navigation system for orienting and tracking the position of blind people in complex environments. The prototype system is based on the inertial navigation system and experiments have been performed on NXT Mindstorms platform.},

The robot was transporting goods and samples for an orthopedic department, moving within and between different departments for 13 days, and was used by the staff for five days. Based on this case, we discuss how the robot was perceived by staff and visitors and purpose an initial framework, a utopian model, describing four different perspectives; an alien, a machine, a worker and as a work partner. This has been derived from interviews, questionnaires and observation, and exemplifies different qualities that the robot was ascribed. We discuss how the perspectives may mutually co-exist and change, and are affected by time and familiarity with the robot at work.},
